p So you have imported some data from a statistics site. These are the first things that you do. (#[a(href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2rDd7IKsi2oSb1FRMBkaF_ODraySCUICOmbZ05u3PQ") Example])

h3.numbered Let your table start in cell A1
p Make sure to remove all headers, footers and comments. Your data sheet should contain only data, and it should start in cell #[code.cell A1], with the first column name. You want column names on row 1, and values in the remaining rows.

h3.numbered Remove all aggreggates
p You do not want any rows with totals and sub totals in your data. Every row should represent the same thing. In a sheet containing municipality populations, each row should represent a municipality. Rows with county population do not &mdash; they belong in a different sheet.

h3.numbered Fill out row labels 
p Sometimes only the first in a series of rows is labeled. We want to explicitly label reach and every row. You can achieve this with a clever little !{f("if")} formula. This formula will check if column A is empty in the example pictured, and if so, take the value from the previous cell: !{f("if", 'A2=""', 'D1', 'A2')}
