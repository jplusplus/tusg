p So you have downloaded some data from a statistics site? These are the first things that you do. (#[a(href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2rDd7IKsi2oSb1FRMBkaF_ODraySCUICOmbZ05u3PQ") Example])

h3.numbered Let your table start in cell A1
p Make sure to remove all headers, footers and comments. Your data sheet should contain only data, and it should start in cell #[code.cell A1], with the first column name. You want column names on row 1, and values in the remaining rows. Any footnotes or comments that you might need later can be dropped in a separate sheet in your workbook, or in a text document in the same folder.

  Good

h3.numbered Remove all aggreggates
p You do not want any rows with totals and sub totals in your data. Every row should represent the same thing. In a sheet containing municipality populations, each row should represent a municipality. Rows with county population do not &mdash; they belong in a different sheet and should be deleted.

h3.numbered Fill out row labels 
p Sometimes only the first in a series of rows is labeled. We want to explicitly label reach and every row. You can achieve this with a clever little !{f("if")} formula. This formula will check if column A is empty in the example pictured, and if so, take the value from the previous cell: !{f("if", 'A2=""', 'D1', 'A2')}

  In this screenshot we use an English formula name, and comma as separator. This might be different in your environment (see above).

p If you want to sort, or otherwise reorder this sheet, you have to copy and #[em paste values] only to remove the formulas, as they will break when the row order changes.
